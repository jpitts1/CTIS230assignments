<em>History</em><br>

<p>The Red Hot Chili Peppers first came together in the late 1970s. “The roots of the band lie in a friendship forged by three school friends, Anthony Kiedis, Michael Balzary, and Hillel Slovak, while they attended Fairfax High School in California back in the late '70s and early '80s. While Balzary and Slovak showed great musical promise (on trumpet and guitar, respectively), Kiedis focused on poetry and acting during his high school years. During this time, Slovak taught Balzary how to play bass, while the duo encouraged Kiedis to start putting his poetry to music, which he soon did”, a writer from All Music writes. After getting another friend, Jack Irons, to eventually join the group, the aspiring musicians formed a group called Tony Flow & the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem. With this, the four friends from Los Angeles began to perform and find their sound and their gimmick. In 1983, Balzary started going by the name Flea, and the band also changed their name to The Red Hot Chili Peppers. During their years of coming up in the music industry, the band went through a lot of changes. Irons and Slovak left the band right before the release of their first album, and were replaced by Cliff Martinez and guitarist Jack Sherman. The two originals returned to the group after the album failed to make the waves they had hoped for. They all continued on with making music together until, when in 1988, Hillel Slovak passed away from a drug overdose. This tragedy had caused Jack Irons to leave the group for good. However, it wasn’t over for the Chili Peppers. After trying out new members, they assembled a new lineup, featuring guitarist John Frusciante and drummer Chad Smith. This new lineup would go on to create the iconic Red Hot Chili Peppers sounds that we all know and love today. After being with the band for over ten years, John Frusciante would eventually end up leaving the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 2008. He was replaced by guitarist Josh Klinghoffer who would play with the band for ten years. In 2019, Klinghoffer would end up leaving the band when Frusciante would decide to return to The Red Hot Chili Peppers. The group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012.</p><br>

<em>Discography</em><br>

<p>The Red Hot Chili Peppers very first album, released in 1984 shared the same name as the band. This album however, did not reach much commercial success. This album was followed up by Freaky Styley, released in 1985, and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan, which was released in 1987. These two albums also did not reach much commercial success. This started to turn around, however, when in 1989, the band released Mother’s Milk, which debuted at number 52 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart. The album that launched The Red Hot Chili Peppers into the mainstream was an album entitled, Blood Sugar Sex Magik, their first top 10 hit album, which was released in 1991. This album was a big commercial success and finally gave them their big break. Blood Sugar Sex Magik, for many, is the band’s magnum opus. They followed up this album with One Hot Minute, which was also a commercial success, as the album went to number 4 on the Billboard. In 1999, the band released what may be their most remembered album to date, Californication. This hit album featured some of the band's most notable songs, such as: “Californication”, “Scar Tissue”, “Otherside”, and "Around the World”. For me personally, this is the band’s greatest album. In 2002, they released By the Way, which was also a massive hit, reaching number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. And it didn’t stop there, when in 2006, The Red Hot Chili Peppers released Stadium Arcadium. This album marked the band’s first number one hit album. The Red Hot Chili Peppers would go on to release four more albums, all of them reaching the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. One of them, Unlimited Love, even reached number one on the Billboard. While the band would have no number one hit singles, they did have 3 top 10 hit singles, including “Under the Bridge”, “Dani California”, and “Scar Tissue”.</p>
